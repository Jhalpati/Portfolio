## About me

I am a Front-end developer based in London.<br/>
Recently, I graduated from Goldsmiths, University of London with a BSc Computer Science degree.<br/>
I like building websites and web-applications, which are useful to users and learn technologies.<br/>
When I'm not busy building anything, you can find me watching new Movies/TV shows on different platforms available.
